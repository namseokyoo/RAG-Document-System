## Observations & Next Steps
- Coverage spans OLED, QLED, MicroLED, Display systems, Graphene, and Perovskite domains with publication dates up to 2025.
- No PPTX/XLSX/TXT documents are embedded yet (PDF-only corpus).
- Recommend validating metadata (authors, institutions, years) if metadata-aware search will be implemented.
- For exhaustive retrieval tests, prepare queries across all six categories to confirm diversity handling.
